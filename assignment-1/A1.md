## Q1. Internet Protocol Configuration (ipconfig)

### a.

| Device  | IPv4 Address | Subnet Mask   | Default Gateway |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------- | --------------- |
| PC0     | 10.0.0.4     | 255.255.255.0 | 10.0.0.1        |
| PC1     | 10.0.0.3     | 255.255.255.0 | 10.0.0.1        |
| Laptop0 | 10.0.0.2     | 255.255.255.0 | 10.0.0.1        |
| PC2     | 172.16.0.3   | 255.255.255.0 | 172.16.0.1      |
| Laptop1 | 192.168.1.2  | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.1.1     |

### b.

Each device connected to its respective router will have a unique IPv4 address in that local network.

The default gateway (router's address) will be the same for all devices connected to the same local network.

The subnet mask is the same across all because there is only one logical partition for each respective local network.

### c.

All of the information comes from the router when a certain device connects to the router.

The router provides the device a unique local IP address through DHCP and then can communicate with the other devices on the same local network and the outside internet through the router.

### d.

When a device can no longer communicate with other devices on the same local network and misconfiguration is suspected, we should verify if the host's network settings have been tampered with and bring them back be automatically managed by DHCP, then the command `ipconfig /renew` can be used to acquire new information through DHCP.

# Q2. Ping

### a.

| Hosts   |         | Average Time (ms) |
| ------- | ------- | ----------------- |
| From    | To      |                   |
| PC0     | Laptop0 | 0 ms              |
| PC1     | PC0     | 0 ms              |
| Laptop0 | PC1     | 0 ms              |
| Laptop1 | PC2     | 3 ms              |
| Laptop1 | PC0     | 2 ms              |

### b.

Varies based on the legnth travel to the end point.

### c.

If the computer doesn't have the proper internet protocol selected.

### d.

Advantages of ping, allows user to determine if packet are sent succesfully. Disadvantages are you need the IP address of the target to use it.

# Q3. Tracert/Traceroute â€“ 12.5 points

### a.

| Hosts   |         | Path(s)                                          |
| ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| From    | To      |                                                  |
| PC0     | PC2     | 10.0.0.1 &#8594; 126.7.128.1 &#8594; 172.16.0.3  |
| Laptop0 | PC0     | 10.0.0.4                                         |
| PC2     | Laptop1 | 172.16.0.1 &#8594; 128.3.2.2 &#8594; 192.168.1.2 |

### b.

It would take the fastest path from PC0 to Laptop1, similarly to PC2 &#8594; Laptop1. Therefore, start from hosts as PC0, 10.0.0.0/24 &#8594; 78.92.182.0/30 &#8594; 192.168.1.0/24, reaching Laptop 1.

### c.

Result are not consistent from B. It's routing itself to the Concordia network edge then going to the moodle network edge with the following pathing : 10.0.0.1 &#8594; 126.7.128.1 &#8594; 128.3.2.2 &#8594; 192.168.1.2. The home network edge might not have Internet exchange point (IXP) to the moodle network edge therefore requires to passby the concordia network edge.

### d.

Traceroute discovers all the routers between the host to its destination. It can help to identify routing issues that could impact end-users and applications. Some limitation of traceroute are that firewalls between a source and a destination host may block the probe packets, causing traceroute to return without any result.

# Q4. Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

### a.

| Internet Address | Physical Address | Type    |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| 10.0.0.3         | 00e0.b0d1.7ba5   | dynamic |

### b.

| Internet Address | Physical Address | Type    |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| 10.0.0.1         | 0007.ec65.b901   | dynamic |
| 10.0.0.3         | 00e0.b0d1.7ba5   | dynamic |

It displayed the connection path to Laptop 1. There doesn't seem to be any inconsistency the Ip are still dynamic but hasn't change, and the physical address are still connected to the same ip address.

### c.

The advantages of ARP it's that it displayed the ip address as well as it's phyysical address. If it's type is dynamic we know that the ip address may varie to each physical addresses.

# Q5. Troubleshooting Topologies in CPT

| Device  | IPv4 Address    | Subnet Mask   | Default Gateway | Physical Address |
| ------- | --------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| PC0     | 10.0.0.5        | 255.255.255.0 | 0.0.0.0         | 0002.4aeb.44d2   |
| PC1     | 169.254.123.165 | 255.255.0.0   | 0.0.0.0         | 00e0.b0d1.7ba5   |
| Laptop0 | 169.254.118.173 | 255.255.0.0   | 0.0.0.0         | 0007.ec8b.76ad   |
| PC2     | 172.16.0.3      | 255.255.255.0 | 172.16.0.1      | 00e0.a3a8.2b1d   |
| Laptop1 | 192.168.1.2     | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.1.1     | 00d0.ba9a.0c4d   |

We notice ipthe PC1 and Laptop0 Subnet Mask different from the other end devices.

Pinging PC1 from PC0, return a request timed out with a 100% packet loss, similarly from PC1 to Laptop0 we receive the same message. However, PC1 and Laptop0 can ping one another just fine.

Systems within the same subnet can communicate directly with each other, while systems on different subnets must communicate through a router. Therefore, subnetworks can be used to partition multiple networks and limit the traffic between them.

By going through the configuration under Config and then Global/Setting, also changing the subnet mask under Interface/FastEthernet0 we noticed the ip configuration being different between the different subnet mask. By changing the setting of PC1 and Laptop0, they are now all connected on the same network.

Resulting in the following changes :

| Device  | IPv4 Address | Subnet Mask   | Default Gateway | Physical Address |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| PC0     | 10.0.0.5     | 255.255.255.0 | 10.0.0.1        | 0002.4aeb.44d2   |
| PC1     | 10.0.0.4     | 255.255.255.0 | 10.0.0.1        | 00e0.b0d1.7ba5   |
| Laptop0 | 10.0.0.3     | 255.255.255.0 | 10.0.0.1        | 0007.ec8b.76ad   |
| PC2     | 172.16.0.3   | 255.255.255.0 | 172.16.0.1      | 00e0.a3a8.2b1d   |
| Laptop1 | 192.168.1.2  | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.1.1     | 00d0.ba9a.0c4d   |

# Q6. Creating Topologies in CPT

| Device | IPv4 Address | Subnet Mask     | Default Gateway | Physical Address |
| ------ | ------------ | --------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| PC0    | 1.2.3.4      | 255.255.255.192 | 1.2.3.5         | 00e0.f9a8.8c21   |
| PC1    | 5.4.3.2      | 255.255.255.128 | 5.4.3.1         | 0009.7c52.7a73   |
