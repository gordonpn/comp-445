## Q1. Internet Protocol Configuration (ipconfig)

### a

| Device  | IPv4 Address | Subnet Mask   | Default Gateway |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------- | --------------- |
| PC0     | 10.0.0.2     | 255.255.255.0 | 10.0.0.1        |
| PC1     | 10.0.0.4     | 255.255.255.0 | 10.0.0.1        |
| Laptop0 | 10.0.0.3     | 255.255.255.0 | 10.0.0.1        |
| PC2     | 172.16.0.3   | 255.255.255.0 | 172.16.0.1      |
| Laptop1 | 192.168.1.2  | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.1.1     |

### b

Each device connected to its respective router will have a unique IPv4 address in that local network.

The default gateway (router's address) will be the same for all devices connected to the same local network.

The subnet mask is the same across all because there is only one logical partition for each respective local network.

### c

All of the information comes from the router when a certain device connects to the router.

The router provides the device a unique local IP address through DHCP and then can communicate with the other devices on the same local network and the outside internet through the router.

### d

When a device can no longer communicate with other devices on the same local network and misconfiguration is suspected, we should verify if the host's network settings have been tampered with and bring them back be automatically managed by DHCP, then the command `ipconfig /renew` can be used to acquire new information through DHCP.
